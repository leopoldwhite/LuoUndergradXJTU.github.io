<b>Twitter Bot Detection</b>,"Twitter is home to an ample amount of automated programs, which are also known as Twitter bots. We propose Twitter bot detection solutions which addresses limitations of existing datasets, aiming to generalize and adapt while conducting graph-based and heterogeneity-aware bot detection. </br>People: Shangbin Feng, Herun Wan, Ningnan Wang, Zhaoxuan Tan",,FALSE,FALSE,LIT
<b>Political Perspective Detection</b>,"Political perspective detection aims to identify the political stances expressed in textual data. We conduct knowledge-aware perspective detection by integrating knowledge graphs while also studying the novel task of entity stance prediction. </br>People: Shangbin Feng, Zilong Chen, Qingyao Li, Peisheng Yu",,FALSE,TRUE,LIT
<b>Knowledge Graph Representation Learning</b>,"Knowledge graphs are structural representations of real-world knowledge and they could also be leveraged for knowledge-aware applications. We study knowledge graph representation learning while focusing on incorporating self-supervised learning and contrastive learning schema.</br>  People: Zhaoxuan Tan, Zhenyu Lei, Zilong Chen",,FALSE,TRUE,LIT
<b>Data Efficiency on GNNs</b>,"Few-shot learning with graph neural networks has been an active and promising research direction. We study data efficiency issues on non-homogeneous graphs with a focus on heterogeneous graphs and temporal graphs.</br> People: Qingyue Zhang, Binchi Zhang",,FALSE,TRUE,LIT
<b>Distributed GCN Training Model</b>,"Although GCN and its variants have achieved impressive performance on learning representation of graph-structured data, it's still challenging to implement a GCN model in real-world problems where user data are scattered in remote clients networks. We propose a graph sampling based distributed GCN training model with privacy concern, aiming to provide a new paradigm for privacy preserving machine learning on graph-structured data.</br>People: Binchi Zhang",,FALSE,FALSE,LIT
<b>Knowledge-aware Text Analysis</b>,"In addition to textual content, people leverage background knowledge to better understand natural language and complement the reasoning process. We study knowledge-aware text analysis with a focus on text classification with the help of relevant knowledge graphs.</br> People: Wenqian Zhang, Shangbin Feng",,FALSE,TRUE,LIT
<b>Anomaly Detection on Heterogeneous Graphs</b>,"Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal nodes and edges on network data. Existing methods are generally built on homogeneous graphs, and we work on building graph anomaly detection architectures for heterogeneous graphs and jointly leverage cross-view cross-relation interactions.</br>People: Shujie Yang, Binchi Zhang, Shangbin Feng",,FALSE,TRUE,LIT
<b>Neural Architecture Search with GNNs</b>,"Neural architecture search aims to automatically identify effective and efficient network structure for deep learning tasks. We research to find optimal GNNs and improve their efficiency with neural architecture search approaches.</br>People: Xinshun Feng, Herun Wan",,FALSE,TRUE,LIT
<b>Online Misinformation Detection</b>,"There are many angles towards the problem of misinformation detection: knowledge-aware, graph-based, multi-modal and NLP-centered. We aim to fuse these directions and propose a comprehensive fake news detection approach.</br>People: Hongrui Wang, Ningnan Wang, Herun Wan",,FALSE,TRUE,LIT
