}","Twitter users operated by automated programs, also known as bots, have increased their appearance recently and induced undesirable social effects. While extensive research efforts have been devoted to the task of Twitter bot detection, previous methods leverage only a small fraction of user semantic and profile information, which leads to their failure in identifying bots that exploit multi-modal user information to disguise as genuine users. Apart from that, the state-of-the-art bot detectors fail to leverage user follow relationships and the graph structure it forms. As a result, these methods fall short of capturing new generations of Twitter bots that act in groups and seem genuine individually. To address these two challenges of Twitter bot detection, we propose BotRGCN, which is short for Bot detection with Relational Graph Convolutional Networks. BotRGCN addresses the challenge of community by constructing a heterogeneous graph from follow relationships and apply relational graph convolutional networks to the Twittersphere. Apart from that, BotRGCN makes use of multi-modal user semantic and property information to avoid feature engineering and augment its ability to capture bots with diversified disguise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BotRGCN outperforms competitive baselines on a comprehensive benchmark TwiBot-20 which provides follow relationships. BotRGCN is also proved to effectively leverage three modals of user information, namely semantic, property and neighborhood information, to boost bot detection performance.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely adopted for graph representation learning and achieved impressive performance. For larger graphs stored separately on different clients, distributed GCN training algorithms were proposed to improve efficiency and scalability. However, existing methods directly exchange node features between different clients, which results in data privacy leakage. Federated learning was incorporated in graph learning to tackle data privacy, while they suffer from severe performance drop due to non-iid data distribution. Besides, these approaches generally involve heavy communication and memory overhead during the training process. In light of these problems, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Subgraph sampling based distributed GCN training method (PPSGCN), which preserves data privacy and significantly cuts back on communication and memory overhead. Specifically, PPSGCN employs a star-topology client-server system. We firstly sample a local node subset in each client to form a global subgraph, which greatly reduces communication and memory costs. We then conduct local computation on each client with features or gradients of the sampled nodes. Finally, all clients securely communicate with the central server with homomorphic encryption to combine local results while preserving data privacy. Compared with federated graph learning methods, our PPSGCN model is trained on a global graph to avoid the negative impact of local data distribution. We prove that our PPSGCN algorithm would converge to a local optimum with probability 1. Experiment results on three prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm significantly reduces communication and memory overhead while maintaining desirable performance. Further studies not only demonstrate the fast convergence of PPSGCN, but discuss the trade-off between communication and local computation cost as well.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Twitter bot detection has become an important and challenging task to combat misinformation and protect the integrity of the online discourse. State-of-the-art approaches generally leverage the topological structure of the Twittersphere, while they neglect the heterogeneity of relations and influence among users. In this paper, we propose a novel bot detection framework to alleviate this problem, which leverages the topological structure of user-formed heterogeneous graphs and models varying influence intensity between users. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous information network with users as nodes and diversified relations as edges. We then propose relational graph transformers to model heterogeneous influence between users and learn node representations. Finally, we use semantic attention networks to aggregate messages across users and relations and conduct heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive Twitter bot detection benchmark. Additional studies also bear out the effectiveness of our proposed relational graph transformers, semantic attention networks and the graph-based approach in general.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Identifying political perspective in news media has become an important task due to the rapid growth of political commentary and the increasingly polarized ideologies. Previous approaches only focus on leveraging the semantic information and leaves out the rich social and political context that helps individuals understand political stances. In this paper, we propose a perspective detection method that incorporates external knowledge of real-world politics. Specifically, we construct a contemporary political knowledge graph with 1,071 entities and 10,703 triples. We then build a heterogeneous information network for each news document that jointly models article semantics and external knowledge in knowledge graphs. Finally, we apply gated relational graph convolutional networks and conduct political perspective detection as graph-level classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves the best performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.49%. Numerous ablation studies further bear out the necessity of external knowledge and the effectiveness of our graph-based approach.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Political stance detection has become an important task due to the increasingly polarized political ideologies. Most existing works focus on identifying perspectives in news articles or social media posts, while social entities, such as individuals and organizations, produce these texts and actually take stances. In this paper, we propose the novel task of entity stance prediction, which aims to predict entities' stances given their social and political context. Specifically, we retrieve facts from Wikipedia about social entities regarding contemporary U.S. politics. We then annotate social entities' stances towards political ideologies with the help of domain experts. After defining the task of entity stance prediction, we propose a graph-based solution, which constructs a heterogeneous information network from collected facts and adopts gated relational graph convolutional networks for representation learning. Our model is then trained with a combination of supervised, self-supervised and unsupervised loss functions, which are motivated by multiple social and political phenomenons. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with existing text and graph analysis baselines. Our model achieves highest stance detection accuracy and yields inspiring insights regarding social entity stances. We further conduct ablation study and parameter analysis to study the mechanism and effectiveness of our proposed approach.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,,
