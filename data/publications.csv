}","Like many of the disasters that have preceded it, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a profound impact on people’s mental health. Understanding its impact can inform strategies for mitigating negative consequences. This work seeks to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health by examining how discussions on mental health subreddits have changed in the three months following the WHO’s declaration of a global pandemic. First, the rate at which the pandemic is discussed in each community is quantified. Then, volume of activity is measured to determine whether the number of people with mental health concerns has risen, and user interactions are analyzed to determine how they have changed during the pandemic. Finally, the content of the discussions is analyzed. Each of these metrics is considered with respect to a set of control subreddits to better understand if the changes present are specific to mental health subreddits or are representative of Reddit as a whole. There are numerous changes in the three mental health subreddits that we consider, r/Anxiety, r/depression, r/SuicideWatch; there is reduced posting activity in most cases, and there are significant changes in discussion of some topics such as work and anxiety. The results suggest that there is not an overwhelming increase in online mental health support-seeking on Reddit during the pandemic, but that discussion content related to mental health has changed.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Twitter has become a vital social media platform while an ample amount of malicious Twitter bots exist and induce undesirable social effects. Successful Twitter bot detection proposals are generally supervised, which rely heavily on large-scale datasets. However, existing benchmarks generally suffer from low levels of user diversity, limited user information and data scarcity. Therefore, these datasets are not sufficient to train and stably benchmark bot detection measures. To alleviate these problems, we present TwiBot-20, a massive Twitter bot detection benchmark, which contains 229,573 users, 33,488,192 tweets, 8,723,736 user property items and 455,958 follow relationships. TwiBot-20 covers diversified bots and genuine users to better represent the real-world Twittersphere. TwiBot-20 also includes three modals of user information to support both binary classification of single users and community-aware approaches. To the best of our knowledge, TwiBot-20 is the largest Twitter bot detection benchmark to date. We reproduce competitive bot detection methods and conduct a thorough evaluation on TwiBot-20 and two other public datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that existing bot detection measures fail to match their previously claimed performance on TwiBot-20, which suggests that Twitter bot detection remains a challenging task and requires further research efforts.",SWS_Twitter_Bot_Detection,NUS SoC Summer Workshop 2021,"Shangbin Feng, Herun Wan, Qingyue Zhang, Zhaoxuan Tan",,2021,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,,
