}","Twitter has become a vital social media platform while an ample amount of malicious Twitter bots exist and induce undesirable social effects. Successful Twitter bot detection proposals are generally supervised, which rely heavily on large-scale datasets. However, existing benchmarks generally suffer from low levels of user diversity, limited user information and data scarcity. Therefore, these datasets are not sufficient to train and stably benchmark bot detection measures. To alleviate these problems, we present TwiBot-20, a massive Twitter bot detection benchmark, which contains 229,573 users, 33,488,192 tweets, 8,723,736 user property items and 455,958 follow relationships. TwiBot-20 covers diversified bots and genuine users to better represent the real-world Twittersphere. TwiBot-20 also includes three modals of user information to support both binary classification of single users and community-aware approaches. To the best of our knowledge, TwiBot-20 is the largest Twitter bot detection benchmark to date. We reproduce competitive bot detection methods and conduct a thorough evaluation on TwiBot-20 and two other public datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that existing bot detection measures fail to match their previously claimed performance on TwiBot-20, which suggests that Twitter bot detection remains a challenging task and requires further research efforts.",TwiBot-20_poster,TwiBot-20: A Comprehensive Twitter Bot Detection Benchmark,"Shangbin Feng, Herun Wan, Ningnan Wang, Jundong Li, Minnan Luo",ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM),2021,,LIT,TRUE,,,,,,,

}","Twitter has become a major social media platform since its launching in 2006, while complaints about bot accounts have increased recently. Although extensive research efforts have been made, the state-of-the-art bot detection methods fall short of generalizability and adaptability. Specifically, previous bot detectors leverage only a small fraction of user information and are often trained on datasets that only cover few types of bots. As a result, they fail to generalize to real-world scenarios on the Twittersphere where different types of bots co-exist. Additionally, bots in Twitter are constantly evolving to evade detection. Previous efforts, although effective once in their context, fail to adapt to new generations of Twitter bots. To address the two challenges of Twitter bot detection, we propose SATAR, a self-supervised representation learning framework of Twitter users, and apply it to the task of bot detection. In particular, SATAR generalizes by jointly leveraging the semantics, property and neighborhood information of a specific user. Meanwhile, SATAR adapts by pre-training on a massive number of self-supervised users and fine-tuning on detailed bot detection scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SATAR outperforms competitive baselines on different bot detection datasets of varying information completeness and collection time. SATAR is also proved to generalize in real-world scenarios and adapt to evolving generations of social media bots.",SATAR_poster,SATAR: A Self-supervised Approach to Twitter Account Representation Learning and its Application in Bot Detection,"Shangbin Feng, Herun Wan, Ningnan Wang, Jundong Li, Minnan Luo",ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM),2021,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Twitter users operated by automated programs, also known as bots, have increased their appearance recently and induced undesirable social effects. While extensive research efforts have been devoted to the task of Twitter bot detection, previous methods leverage only a small fraction of user semantic and profile information, which leads to their failure in identifying bots that exploit multi-modal user information to disguise as genuine users. Apart from that, the state-of-the-art bot detectors fail to leverage user follow relationships and the graph structure it forms. As a result, these methods fall short of capturing new generations of Twitter bots that act in groups and seem genuine individually. To address these two challenges of Twitter bot detection, we propose BotRGCN, which is short for Bot detection with Relational Graph Convolutional Networks. BotRGCN addresses the challenge of community by constructing a heterogeneous graph from follow relationships and apply relational graph convolutional networks to the Twittersphere. Apart from that, BotRGCN makes use of multi-modal user semantic and property information to avoid feature engineering and augment its ability to capture bots with diversified disguise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BotRGCN outperforms competitive baselines on a comprehensive benchmark TwiBot-20 which provides follow relationships. BotRGCN is also proved to effectively leverage three modals of user information, namely semantic, property and neighborhood information, to boost bot detection performance.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Twitter bot detection has become an important and challenging task to combat misinformation and protect the integrity of the online discourse. State-of-the-art approaches generally leverage the topological structure of the Twittersphere, while they neglect the heterogeneity of relations and influence among users. In this paper, we propose a novel bot detection framework to alleviate this problem, which leverages the topological structure of user-formed heterogeneous graphs and models varying influence intensity between users. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous information network with users as nodes and diversified relations as edges. We then propose relational graph transformers to model heterogeneous influence between users and learn node representations. Finally, we use semantic attention networks to aggregate messages across users and relations and conduct heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive Twitter bot detection benchmark. Additional studies also bear out the effectiveness of our proposed relational graph transformers, semantic attention networks and the graph-based approach in general.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Identifying political perspective in news media has become an important task due to the rapid growth of political commentary and the increasingly polarized ideologies. Previous approaches only focus on leveraging the semantic information and leaves out the rich social and political context that helps individuals understand political stances. In this paper, we propose a perspective detection method that incorporates external knowledge of real-world politics. Specifically, we construct a contemporary political knowledge graph with 1,071 entities and 10,703 triples. We then build a heterogeneous information network for each news document that jointly models article semantics and external knowledge in knowledge graphs. Finally, we apply gated relational graph convolutional networks and conduct political perspective detection as graph-level classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves the best performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.49%. Numerous ablation studies further bear out the necessity of external knowledge and the effectiveness of our graph-based approach.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a successful method for unsupervised graph representation learning. Most graph CL methods first perform stochastic augmentation on the input graph to obtain two graph views and maximize the agreement of representations in the two views. Despite the prosperous development of graph CL methods, the design of graph augmentation schemes -- a crucial component in CL -- remains rarely explored. We argue that the data augmentation schemes should preserve intrinsic structures and attributes of graphs, which will force the model to learn representations that are insensitive to perturbation on unimportant nodes and edges. However, most existing methods adopt uniform data augmentation schemes, like uniformly dropping edges and uniformly shuffling features, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive representation learning method with adaptive augmentation that incorporates various priors for topological and semantic aspects of the graph. Specifically, on the topology level, we design augmentation schemes based on node centrality measures to highlight important connective structures. On the node attribute level, we corrupt node features by adding more noise to unimportant node features, to enforce the model to recognize underlying semantic information. We perform extensive experiments of node classification on a variety of real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines and even surpasses some supervised counterparts, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed contrastive framework with adaptive augmentation.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,
