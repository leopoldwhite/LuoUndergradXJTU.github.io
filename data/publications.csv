","Graph anomaly detection on attributed networks has become a prevalent research topic due to its broad applications in many influential domains. In real-world scenarios, nodes and edges in attributed networks usually display distinct heterogeneity, i.e. attributes of different types of nodes show great variety, different types of relations represent diverse meanings. Anomalies usually perform differently from the majority in various perspectives of heterogeneity in these networks. However, existing graph anomaly detection approaches do not leverage heterogeneity in attributed networks, which is highly related to anomaly detection. In light of this problem, we propose AHEAD: a heterogeneity-aware unsupervised graph anomaly detection approach based on the encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, for the encoder, we design three levels of attention, i.e. attribute level, node type level, and edge level attentions to capture the heterogeneity of network structure, node properties and information of a single node, respectively. In the decoder, we exploit structure, attribute, and node type reconstruction terms to obtain an anomaly score for each node. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AHEAD on several real-world heterogeneous information networks compared with the state-of-arts in the unsupervised setting. Further experiments verify the effectiveness and robustness of our triple attention, model backbone, and decoder in general.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,,

","Twitter bot detection is an important and meaningful task. Existing text-based methods can deeply analyze user tweet content, achieving high performance. However, novel Twitter bots evade these detections by stealing genuine users' tweets and diluting malicious content with benign tweets. These novel bots are proposed to be characterized by semantic inconsistency. In addition, methods leveraging Twitter graph structure are recently emerging, showing great competitiveness. However, hardly a method has made text and graph modality deeply fused and interacted to leverage both advantages and learn the relative importance of the two modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel model named BIC that makes the text and graph modalities deeply interactive and detects tweet semantic inconsistency. Specifically, BIC contains a text propagation module, a graph propagation module to conduct bot detection respectively on text and graph structure, and a proven effective text-graph interactive module to make the two interact. Besides, BIC contains a semantic consistency detection module to learn semantic consistency information from tweets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms competitive baselines on a comprehensive Twitter bot benchmark. We also prove the effectiveness of the proposed interaction and semantic consistency detection.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,,

","Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) aim to map entities and relations to low dimensional spaces and have become the \textit{de-facto} standard for knowledge graph completion. Most existing KGE methods suffer from the sparsity challenge, where it is harder to predict entities that appear less frequently in knowledge graphs. In this work, we propose a novel framework KRACL to alleviate the widespread sparsity in KGs with graph context and contrastive learning. Firstly, we propose the Knowledge Relational Attention Network (KRAT) to leverage the graph context by simultaneously projecting neighboring triples to different latent spaces and jointly aggregating messages with the attention mechanism. KRAT is capable of capturing the subtle semantic information and importance of different context triples as well as leveraging multi-hop information in knowledge graphs. Secondly, we propose the knowledge contrastive loss by combining the contrastive loss with cross entropy loss, which introduces more negative samples and thus enriches the feedback to sparse entities. Our experiments demonstrate that KRACL achieves superior results across various standard knowledge graph benchmarks, especially on WN18RR and NELL-995 which have large numbers of low in-degree entities. Extensive experiments also bear out KRACL's effectiveness in handling sparse knowledge graphs and robustness against noisy triples.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,,

","Current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from the over-smoothing problem, which results in indistinguishable node representations and low model performance with more GNN layers. Many methods have been put forward to tackle this problem in recent years. However, existing tackling over-smoothing methods emphasize model performance and neglect the over-smoothness of node representations. Additional, different approaches are applied one at a time, while there lacks an overall framework to jointly leverage multiple solutions to the over-smoothing challenge which causes poor model performance. To solve these problems, we propose GraTO, a framework based on neural architecture search to automatically search for GNNs architecture. GraTO adopts a novel loss function to facilitate striking a balance between model performance and representation smoothness. In addition to existing methods, our search space also includes DropAttribute, a novel scheme for alleviating the over-smoothing challenge, to fully leverage diverse solutions. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets to evaluate GraTo, which demonstrates that GraTo outperforms baselines in the over-smoothing metrics and achieves competitive performance in accuracy. GraTO is especially effective and robust with increasing numbers of GNN layers. Further experiments bear out the quality of node representations learned with GraTO and the effectiveness of model architecture.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Twitter bot detection has become an increasingly important task to combat misinformation, facilitate social media moderation, and preserve the integrity of the online discourse. State-of-the-art bot detection methods generally leverage the graph structure of the Twitter network, and they exhibit promising performance when confronting novel Twitter bots that traditional methods fail to detect. However, very few of the existing Twitter bot detection datasets are graph-based, and even these few graph-based datasets suffer from limited dataset scale, incomplete graph structure, as well as low annotation quality. In fact, the lack of a large-scale graph-based Twitter bot detection benchmark that addresses these issues has seriously hindered the development and evaluation of novel graph-based bot detection approaches. In this paper, we propose TwiBot-22, a comprehensive graph-based Twitter bot detection benchmark that presents the largest dataset to date, provides diversified entities and relations on the Twitter network, and has considerably better annotation quality than existing datasets. In addition, we re-implement 35 representative Twitter bot detection baselines and evaluate them on 9 datasets, including TwiBot-22, to promote a fair comparison of model performance and a holistic understanding of research progress. To facilitate further research, we consolidate all implemented codes and datasets into the TwiBot-22 evaluation framework, where researchers could consistently evaluate new models and datasets.

}","Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely adopted for graph representation learning and achieved impressive performance. For larger graphs stored separately on different clients, distributed GCN training algorithms were proposed to improve efficiency and scalability. However, existing methods directly exchange node features between different clients, which results in data privacy leakage. Federated learning was incorporated in graph learning to tackle data privacy, while they suffer from severe performance drop due to non-iid data distribution. Besides, these approaches generally involve heavy communication and memory overhead during the training process. In light of these problems, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Subgraph sampling based distributed GCN training method (PPSGCN), which preserves data privacy and significantly cuts back on communication and memory overhead. Specifically, PPSGCN employs a star-topology client-server system. We firstly sample a local node subset in each client to form a global subgraph, which greatly reduces communication and memory costs. We then conduct local computation on each client with features or gradients of the sampled nodes. Finally, all clients securely communicate with the central server with homomorphic encryption to combine local results while preserving data privacy. Compared with federated graph learning methods, our PPSGCN model is trained on a global graph to avoid the negative impact of local data distribution. We prove that our PPSGCN algorithm would converge to a local optimum with probability 1. Experiment results on three prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm significantly reduces communication and memory overhead while maintaining desirable performance. Further studies not only demonstrate the fast convergence of PPSGCN, but discuss the trade-off between communication and local computation cost as well.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

Previous approaches only focus on leveraging the semantic information and leaves out the rich social and political context that helps individuals understand political stances. In this paper, we propose a perspective detection method that incorporates external knowledge of real-world politics. Specifically, we construct a contemporary political knowledge graph with 1,071 entities and 10,703 triples. We then build a heterogeneous information network for each news document that jointly models article semantics and external knowledge in knowledge graphs. Finally, we apply gated relational graph convolutional networks and conduct political perspective detection as graph-level classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves the best performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.49%. Numerous ablation studies further bear out the necessity of external knowledge and the effectiveness of our graph-based approach.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Political stance detection has become an important task due to the increasingly polarized political ideologies. Most existing works focus on identifying perspectives in news articles or social media posts, while social entities, such as individuals and organizations, produce these texts and actually take stances. In this paper, we propose the novel task of entity stance prediction, which aims to predict entities' stances given their social and political context. Specifically, we retrieve facts from Wikipedia about social entities regarding contemporary U.S. politics. We then annotate social entities' stances towards political ideologies with the help of domain experts. After defining the task of entity stance prediction, we propose a graph-based solution, which constructs a heterogeneous information network from collected facts and adopts gated relational graph convolutional networks for representation learning. Our model is then trained with a combination of supervised, self-supervised and unsupervised loss functions, which are motivated by multiple social and political phenomenons. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with existing text and graph analysis baselines. Our model achieves highest stance detection accuracy and yields inspiring insights regarding social entity stances. We further conduct ablation study and parameter analysis to study the mechanism and effectiveness of our proposed approach.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,,
